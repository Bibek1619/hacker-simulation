Mini Hacker Simulation Dashboard

A fun and interactive web app that simulates a hacker terminal experience. Users enter a fake target name, and Python generates randomized “hacking sequences,” including progress bars, firewall bypasses, and network node breaches.  

## Features
- Cyberpunk terminal-style interface (HTML/CSS)  
- Fake hacking sequences simulated with Python and NumPy  
- Network node visualizations with Matplotlib  
- Interactive buttons: “Start Mission” & “Mutate Strategy”
